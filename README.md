## Introduction

This project aims to create an interactive maze generation game that utilizes various algorithms to create and solve mazes. By combining classic maze generation techniques with modern game development tools like Unreal Engine, we aim to provide an engaging experience for users to explore and interact with mazes in both 2D and 3D environments.

## Features

- 2D maze generation using C++ algorithms.
- Integration with Unreal Engine for 3D visualization and gameplay.
- Interactive maze solving and exploration.
- Customizable maze generation parameters.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the 2D part of the game, you'll need:

- Visual Studio installed on your system.
- Unreal Engine installed on your system.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/maze-generation-game.git
   ```

2. Open the project in Visual Studio.

3. Follow the instructions provided by Unreal Engine for setting up and running the project in the Unreal Editor.

## Usage

- Build and run the C++ project in Visual Studio to generate mazes using different algorithms.
- Open the Unreal Engine project to explore and interact with the 3D maze environment.
- Customize maze generation parameters and explore different maze configurations.
